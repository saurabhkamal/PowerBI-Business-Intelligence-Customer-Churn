### Some of the formulas used in Data Analysis Expressions (DAX):
1. Number of Customers = COUNT('Datalabel - Data'[Customer ID]
2. Number of Unique Customers = DISTINCTCOUNT('Databel - Data'[Customer ID])
3. Churned = IF('Databel - Data'[Churn Label] = "Yes", 1, 0)
4. Creating a measure for "Number of churned customers"
   Number of Churned Customers = SUM('Databel - Data'[CHURNED])
5. Calculating "Churn Rate"
   Churn Rate = [Number of Churned Customers] / [Number of Customers]
6. Demographics = if('Databel - Data'[Senior]="Yes","Senior", if('Databel - Data'[Under 30]="Yes","Under 30","Other"))
7. Contract Category = SWITCH('Databel - Data'[Contract Type], "One Year", "Yearly", "Two Year", "Yearly", "Monthly")
8. Grouped Consumption = IF('Databel - Data'[Avg Monthly GB Download] < 5, "Less than 5 GB", IF('Databel - Data'[Avg Monthly GB Download] < 10, "Between 5 and 10 GB", "10 or more GB"))
11. Avg Customer Service Calls per customer
   Avg Customer Service Calls = SUM('Datalabel - Data'[Customer Service Calls]) / [Number of Customer]
12. Avg Extra International Charges = SUM('Databel - Data'[Extra International Charges])/[Number of Customers]
13. Avg Extra Data Charges = SUM('Databel - Data'[Extra Data Charges]) / [Number of Customers]
